** Silver **

Silver is an extensible attribute grammar system that support many
modern extensions to Knuth's original design.  These include
higher-order attributes, reference attributes, forwarding, aspects,
and collections attributes.  Its type system support parametric
polymorphism.  Silver is distributed with Copper, a parser and
context-aware scanner generator.

Please note that Silver is a research project and while we do endeavor
to create useful working software there may be bugs and missing
functionality.  Consult with us if you wish to use Silver for
"serious" work.  We make no guarantees about the features or
performance of Silver.
